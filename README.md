##SafeVault: Secure Authentication & Authorization System
#📌 Project Overview
SafeVault is a secure authentication and authorization system built using ASP.NET Core, Razor Pages, and SQL Server. It implements best security practices such as JWT-based authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), input validation, SQL injection prevention, and XSS protection.

#🚀 Features
✅ User Authentication (Login, Signup with secure password hashing)
✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (Admin/User roles)
✅ JWT Authentication (Secure token handling via HTTP-only cookies)
✅ SQL Injection Prevention (Parameterized queries)
✅ XSS Protection (HTML encoding of user input)
✅ Unit Tests for Security (NUnit & xUnit test cases)
✅ Secure Database Integration (SQL Server)

#🔧 Technologies Used
Backend: ASP.NET Core, C#
Frontend: Razor Pages (ASP.NET)
Database: SQL Server (SSMS)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), BCrypt for password hashing
Security Measures: SQL injection prevention, XSS mitigation, Role-based access
Testing Frameworks: NUnit, xUnit

#🛠️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/SafeVault.git
cd SafeVault.Web
2️⃣ Configure Database
Open appsettings.json and update your SQL Server connection string:
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=SafeVaultDB;Trusted_Connection=True;"
}
Run Database Migration
dotnet ef database update
3️⃣ Run the Application
dotnet run
Application will run at http://localhost:5000/

#🔍 Security Measures Implemented
🔹 SQL Injection Prevention → Uses parameterized queries (@parameter)
🔹 XSS Protection → Uses HTML encoding for user inputs
🔹 JWT-Based Authentication → Tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
🔹 Password Security → Uses BCrypt hashing for password storage
🔹 RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) → Users assigned Admin/User roles
🔹 Unit Tests for Security → Ensures authentication & security features work

#✅ Unit Testing with NUnit & xUnit
Run security tests using:

dotnet test
✔ SQL Injection Tests
✔ XSS Protection Tests
✔ Authentication Tests
✔ RBAC (Role-Based Access) Tests

#🚀 Deployment
Build & Publish the Application
dotnet publish -c Release -o publish
Host on IIS / Azure / Docker / GitHub Pages
